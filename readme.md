# On The Map

On The Map is an application thinking on the online learning problem, somehow it is interesting where other students are located, view it on the map and try to learn something from the different locations. With this application you will use your Udacity credentials or your facebook account to get in the app and share your location with other students, you will be able to also provide a link location of where you can learn from you. This application also has an integration with the Flicker API that allow you to see pictures from the different places where students are located.

The goal of this application is to get started with Networking API and how to parse JSON data from an http response, this project also incorporates some more advanced UI elements like a custom error notification and a progress alert view. We are also start looking at Cocoa Pods on how to integrate third party frameworks on the application and how to do some basic testing using Quick.
